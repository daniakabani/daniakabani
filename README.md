### 🌱 Current Learning & Mentorship

* **Current Deep Dive:** Exploring the implications of the new **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)** metric for large-scale e-commerce funnels. (I'm particularly interested in how we can instrument complex event handlers without excessive re-renders).
* **Mentorship:** Always open to connecting with engineers looking to move from Mid-level to Senior/Staff, especially around **technical roadmap creation** and **business alignment**. (I previously led and grew a 13-engineer frontend chapter).
